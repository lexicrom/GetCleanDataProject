Accelerometer Data Analysis

run_Analysis.R contains the script that loads training and testing data. It merges the two datasets into one large dataset. Then, it extracts only the columns that contain mean and standard deviation measurements. It labels the activities in a descriptive way according to the action performed at the time. Finally, it creates a second tidy dataset with the means for each column for each subject and activity type.
